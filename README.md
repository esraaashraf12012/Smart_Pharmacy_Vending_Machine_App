 ## Implementation
The backend of the Pharmacy Vending Machine Application was meticulously developed using PHP and MySQL to ensure robust functionality and secure data management. PHP, a widely-used server-side scripting language, provided the foundation for handling dynamic content generation and server-side logic. MySQL, a powerful relational database management system, was employed to efficiently store and manage data related to prescriptions, products, users, and inventory.
